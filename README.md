# Advent of Code Attempts
Welcome to my repository of my attempts to solve challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! Here, you'll find attempts written in various languages, (not yet) such as Zig, C, and Rust, that effectively solve the challenges.

### shameful disclaimer
As a relatively new developer, I have not gotten the chance to give a try at much challenges. But fear not, for I have been working my way through them! (As of writing, I lost solutions for three challenges thanks to a dramatic Mac that had to be restored!)
