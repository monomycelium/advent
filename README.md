# Advent of Code Attempts
Welcome to my repository of my attempts to solve challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! Here, you'll find attempts written in various languages, (not yet) such as Zig, C, and Rust, that effectively solve the challenges.

### repository layout
While each solved challenge has only been written in a single language, I may change my mind in the future and change the layout. For now, the layout for each day is language-specific, e.g.:
``` tree
.
└── 2022
    ├── day1
    │   └── main.c
    ├── day2
    │   ├── Cargo.toml
    │   └── src
    │       └── main.rs
    └── day3
        ├── build.zig
        ├── input.txt
        └── src
            └── main.zig
```

### shameful disclaimer
As a relatively new developer, I have not gotten the chance to give a try at much challenges. But fear not, for I have been working my way through them! (As of writing, I lost solutions for three challenges thanks to a dramatic Mac that had to be restored!)
